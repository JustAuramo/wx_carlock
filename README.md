Hello FiveM community! I am releasing a simple, ESX and OX_LIB based script: **WX Carlock**

> [ðŸŒ¸ [GITHUB] Download](https://github.com/nwvh/wx_carlock)<br>
> [ðŸŒ¸ [STREAMABLE] Showcase](https://streamable.com/qfepzc)

As the name says, it's a carlock script that uses one simple ESX callback to the database. It includes a big config file where you can modify almost EVERYTHING, without even opening the source code! You can enable/disable settings or even translate the whole script in ONE config file! And the OX_LIB part? I've used ox_lib's notifications and progress bars, but you can replace them if you like. The script is OPEN SOURCE on my GitHub :slight_smile: 

> **Why does it need ESX?**
> > Because there's no way I can get a standalone callback to the database that return the current character player is using... (afaik)


# Update
- Fixed all issues (You don't own this vehicle etc.)
- Added option for vehicle horn on unlock/lock
- Added option for headlights flash on unlock/lock
- Added option to change the target icon straight from the config
- When locking/unlocking vehicle via target, the script will ignore all other vehicle nearby and try to lock/unlock only the one you selected from the target (badly explained i know)
